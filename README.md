Location Aware Names
==================

Encode &amp; Decode Location Aware Names 

Location Aware Names, is a rethinking of how we give name to places ,streets or locations by encoding information right into the letters that form the name

This simple step opens the gates to a whole range of new possibilities and innovations

USAGE:
======
Encoding:
ruby encode.rb 65.7 -170.6

Decoding:
ruby decode.rb RERI-NUCA

Check http://locationawarenames.org to see the concept or to http://ubicate.me to try a proof of concept.

Here are the encode and decode algorithms so you can understand how it works and use it in your website or App.

This is my first public code in Ruby so I'm pretty sure a lot of improvements can be made.
